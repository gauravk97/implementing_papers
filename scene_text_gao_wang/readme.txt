directory structure:

./code : contains all the code files listed here
1. network.py : the final network
2. modules.py : all the necessary modules not already defined in keras
3. batchgenerator.py : self-explanatory

./data : data files required to train/test or a file containing the path to the actual dataset for the project

./files : notes for experiments and weight files and results.

In this project, I would like to follow the concepts of object oriented programming. I am not yet aware of how to do this in pythonic way but I'll figure it out.
